  <title>Creating or finding videos and images</title>
    <shortdesc>You will need to find or have video files or images before creating an animated GIF. Knowing what you want
      to use to create an animated GIF will make the process easier.</shortdesc>

  <conbody>
    <p>You can create your own images and videos or take inspiration from television or films. To create you own content,
      you can take videos or images from your daily life, events, or memorable moments.</p>
    <p id="video">
      Using content of memorable moments on television or film is also another way to create reaction GIFs or GIFs that
      loop a moment. Depending on the type of method you use to create an animated GIF, you may or may not have to convert
      videos to your desktop.</p>
