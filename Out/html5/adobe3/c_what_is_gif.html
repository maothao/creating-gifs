    <p class="p">GIF is a lossless compression image format, which has reduces image size and maintains image quality. It has features
      such as interlacing, color palette of 256 colors, and animation.</p>

      Tumblr or Buzzfeed, animated GIFs are most prominently seen. To create images that are animated, the simplest
      and most used method will be the GIF format. Though color and image quality will not be the best, GIF’s ability
      to create animation more than makes up for it.</p>
