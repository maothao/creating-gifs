      or YouTube videos. You can also create your own images and videos. To create you own content, you can take videos or images from
      your daily life, events, or memorable moments. Videos can be taken from cameras, videocameras, phone cameras, and webcams. The ways

    <p class="p">Remember that videos and images aren't necessarily created with the intent of turning it into an animated GIF. GIFs are created
      more as a way to respond to one another through social media, such as through reaction GIFs, which are used to describe an emotion
      or a specific looped moment. No matter where and how you take inspiration to create GIFs, it provides a fun and interesting way of
      communicating to one another.</p>
