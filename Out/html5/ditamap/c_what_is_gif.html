    <p class="p">GIF is a lossless compression image format, which has reduces image size and maintains image quality. It has features
      such as interlacing, color palette of 256 colors, and animation.</p>

      Tumblr or Buzzfeed, animated GIFs are most prominently seen. To create images that are animated, the simplest

      to create animation more than makes up for it.</p>
